# Frontend challenge

## Getting Started

inside `app` folder:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

## Running the tests

I wrote tests only for a subset of selectors due to time constraints,

`yarn test` to run tests.

## Comments

* I have used `create-react-app` as a boilerplate.

* for personal reasons, unfortunately I did not allocate as much time as I wanted for the challenge, therefore I was not able to implement the UI as I wished.
